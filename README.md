DevOps Engineer - technical interview

Testing goals:

With this test, we want to see your ability to create an entire infrastructure from scratch as well as your skills as a system administrator.

The task:

Your task is to provision a highly available /Gitlab/Discourse/Rails CMS of your choice/. The entry point of the cluster should be a host and port 443.

The solution:

In your solution please emphasize on readability, maintainability and DevOps methodologies. We expect a clear way to recreate your setup.

Use git. We like seeing history of small improvements instead of big pushes with unclear goals.

If you wish, you can use a configuration management tool (We use Ansible). The infrastructure provider is up to you (We use AWS, Vagrant and Docker).

It is not required to implement all the features you can think of. A clean bare minimum working infrastructure is preferred than a full blown solution pieced together with scissors, rope and duct tape. Do not skip security considerations.

When you are finished

Submit your solution to a Github repository and send us a link. It is very unlikely, but not impossible that this test will change. It's always a good idea to fork this repository before you begin.
